<p>⇢ <i>Info</i></p>

Hobbyist software developer. Been programming for almost 3 years, and making user-facing software for half that time.  
I mostly use C++ or C. I like making things purely for fun or what's useful for me.  
[Emacs] is an example of a project for fun, [Comfy] is for my use.

<p>⇢ <i>Interests</i></p>

I like playing Chess, reading Books. You can join with me in my any kind of project, just let me know :).
I'm willing to work with @FsF. Hope one day I'll able to do it.

I watch Anime and Dramas if I'm not busy earning my living :(. I enjoy mainly rational movies and si-fi anime, but basically anything goes.
For dramas, anything as well. I have a MyAnimeList profile linked on my website, and here's [MyDramaList].

Music is like healing power to me. I listen to music almost everyday. Eventually I'll get to making music as well.

Sometimes I doodle in my very bored free time. I can draw small and simple things.
